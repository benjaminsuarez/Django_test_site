** Deploying
   Deploying a web app on pythonAnyweher invovelves pulling code from GitHub and configuring Python Anywhere to recognise it and serve it as a web app.
   There are manual ways of doing this, but PythonAnywhere provides a helper tool:
   pip install --user pythonanywhere
   pa_autoconfigure_django.py https://github.com/<github-username>/app.git
   
   it does the following:
   downloads Github code
   creates virtualenv
   updates settings file with some deployment settings
   sets up database using the manage.py migrate command
   sets up static files
   configures PythonAnywhere to serve the web app via its API
** Testing
- To create the database run:
#+begin_src bash
python manage.py migrate
#+end_src
- start the web server with the following command. 
#+begin_src bash
python manage.py runserver
#+end_src

- To pull any new code into PythonAnywhere: 
  - open up PythonAnywhere consoles page
  - open or start new bash console
  - run:
#+begin_src bash
cd ~/<my-pythonanywhere-domain>.pythonanywhere.com
git pull
#+end_src

- open shell with:
#+begin_src bash
python manage.py shell
#+end_src
